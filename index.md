# Welcome to learning C! 

# The basics: 

1) **#include <stdio.h> needed to run the line of code that starts with printf**

2) **int main() { }; starting point of any code in C and all the code runs inside the curly braces first**

3) **// output a line: this is a comment meaning not part of the code block but a message **

## Syntax and Errors: 

1) **Case sensitivity: most words in code will be in lowercase unless within quotes and comments**

2) **The semicolon: all statements like printf() need to end with a semicolon which identifies the end of the statement and needed for the code to run correctly**

3) **Double quotes: known as a string which must always be surrounded by double quotes**

4) **\n and \t: known as escape sequences and are meant to be placed within double quotes**

5) **gcc: application or GNU compiler collection used to compile C programs**

## Variables

1) **Names can be composed of upper and lower case letters, numbers and underscores**

2) **The first character must be a letter (upper or lowercase)**

3) **No keywords are allowed as the full name (int not allowed but int_count would**

4)
